By default this points to localhost. If you are using chef solo, use role or environment to override this value, if you are using chef search capabilties, you can use wrapper recipes as well to specify the GoCD server ip. Example:\n\n```ruby\nnode.default['go_cd']['server_ip'] = search(:node, 'name:gocd-server').first.ipaddress\ninclude_recipe 'go_cd::agent'\n```\n\nThis cookbook is used along side [container](https://github.com/GoatOS/container) and [xml_file](https://github.com/GoatOS/xml_file) cookbooks to create Continuous Integration servers, capable of running unprivileged LXC containers as part of their [build/test pipelines](https://github.com/GoatOS/GoatOS). An example can be found [here](https://github.com/GoatOS/go_cd/blob/master/functional/lxc_spec.rb) (dogfood :-))\n\n## License\n[Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
